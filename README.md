In this singleplayer game, you will take control of the Shepherd's dog named Dunco. 
It is a 3D platformer game, where you need to catch all of the spirits who escaped from Pandora's box, 
into the wilderness and they hid themselves inside sheeps, rocks or plantlife.
After that, your goal is to find the magical Valashaka at the top of the mountain called Krivan and finish the game.

## Bludisko (Labyrinth)
[Link to game page](https://beapav.itch.io/bludisko)

This single-player puzzle virtual 3D game immerses the player into a virtual world where their task 
is to solve three challenges and find crystal parts within the labyrinth to emerge victory.

The "Bludisko" project was created as a school project in collaboration with my classmate. 
Our task was to design a game for mobile phones as an application for Cardboard 3D glasses. 
Together, we came up with the entire story and game concept.
We adapted the controls so that the player only needed one button on the Cardboard glasses. 
The demo version of the game available online is modified for computer play and can be controlled using only a mouse.
